# ~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)
# ~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as environment variables (PATH and friends) 
. ~/.profile

# ~/.bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line. Command prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use
. ~/.bashrc
